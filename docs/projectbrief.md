# Project Brief

FusionAI Marketplace is a decentralized platform for registering, listing, and purchasing AI models. It leverages blockchain for transparent ownership, model registration, and secure transactions, and uses IPFS for decentralized model storage. The marketplace supports both developers (model creators) and users (model consumers), providing a seamless experience for uploading, discovering, and purchasing AI models.

## Core Requirements
- Register AI models on-chain with metadata (name, description, IPFS hash)
- List models for sale (Copies or Subscription) with price setting
- Allow users to purchase models and gain access
- Display all registered models with details
- Provide dashboards for users (purchases) and developers (owned models)
- Integrate wallet connection (Wagmi, Web3Modal)
- Ensure a responsive, user-friendly UI

## Goals
- Lower barrier for AI model monetization
- Ensure transparent, secure model transactions
- Support both one-time and subscription sales
- Foster a developer/user ecosystem

# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Model registration, listing, and purchase flows are live and stable.
- User and Developer dashboards are implemented and displaying correct data based on wallet connection.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed lint errors and improved UI responsiveness

## Next Steps

## Active Decisions & Considerations

## Insights
- Multi-step wizard for uploads improves user experience
- Clear separation of user vs developer flows is effective

# Product Context

FusionAI Marketplace exists to make AI model sharing, discovery, and monetization accessible and trustless. It solves the problem of centralized gatekeeping in AI model distribution, ensuring that creators retain control and users can verify authenticity and ownership.

## Problems Solved
- Centralized control over AI model access and monetization
- Lack of transparency in model provenance
- Cumbersome payment and access flows

## How It Works
- Developers upload models (mock IPFS for now), register them on-chain, and list for sale
- Users browse, purchase, and access models directly via their wallet
- All transactions are recorded on-chain for transparency

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, step-by-step model upload and listing
- Quick browsing and purchase flows
- Clear status indicators for ownership, access, and transaction state
- Responsive design for all devices
